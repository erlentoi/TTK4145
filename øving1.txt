# Reasons for concurrency and parallelism


 ### What is concurrency? What is parallelism? What's the difference?

   Concurrency is when more than one task is run intertwined, that is,
 the CPU may switch between the different task without neccesairly completing
 them.
 Parallellism is running more than one task simultaneously using multiple cores/CPUs.

 ### Why have machines become increasingly multicore in the past decade?
   CPU speeds have not increased because of massive heat developed for higher clock speeds.
 This has been compensated for by including more cores in CPUs and developing programs
 for multi-threading (taking advantage of muliple cores)

 ### What kinds of problems motivates the need for concurrent execution?
 (Or phrased differently: What problems do concurrency help in solving?)
   Increased performance.  When problems must be solved within a time period


 ### Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
 (Come back to this after you have worked on part 4 of this exercise)

 ### What are the differences between processes, threads, green threads, and coroutines?

 ### Which one of these do `pthread_create()` (C/POSIX), `threading.Thread()` (Python), `go` (Go) create?
  Threads

 ### How does pythons Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) influence the way a python Thread behaves?

 ### With this in mind: What is the workaround for the GIL (Hint: it's another module)?
